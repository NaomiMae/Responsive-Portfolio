    <p>My name is Naomi Johnson, I am 28 years old. I am Philly born and raised, 
        I love cheesesteaks, mango water ice, and soft pretzels. I am the youngest of four children. 
        I’m a Graphic Designer by trade, I love everything that has to do with Art. I work part time at a marketing agency, 
        and as a Freelance Designer.  I’m also a gym rat, I am in the gym at least four times a week. 
        The gym helps me release a lot of stress, 
        I lift heavy weight I see it as a challenge and that excites me.
    </p>
     <p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends and traveling. Within the last three months 
        I’ve been to the Bahamas, Dominican Republic and London. I am always on the go. 
        I am an avid food chaser, I enjoy trying new foods it doesn’t matter what it is, 
        I was even vegan for about six months just to try vegan food. My favorite food is 
        anything that I know is unhealthy for me but I eat it anyway.
